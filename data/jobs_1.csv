**What We're Building**
* A unified model gateway for inference
* Seamless collection of metrics and feedback
* Optimization tools for prompts, models, and inference strategies
* Native experimentation and fallback support
* A data\-and\-learning flywheel for LLMs


**The Platform Brings Together**
* Inference: One API to manage all LLMs with minimal latency overhead
* Observability: Inference data and user feedback fed directly into your systems
* Optimization: From prompt engineering to fine\-tuning and reinforcement learning
* Experimentation: Built\-in A/B testing, smart routing, and fallback capabilities


 The Role
   

  

 We’re hiring a Founding Member of Technical Staff with expertise in front\-end or design engineering.
   

  

 Why not just “engineer”? We encourage cross\-functional ownership — combining product thinking, research instincts, and technical craftsmanship. While we need help building user\-facing tools now, the opportunity exists to contribute across the entire stack over time.
   

  

 Your first major project would likely be developing an open\-source UI — something like the “console” that ties everything together, making it easy for users to visualize and control model behavior, experimentation, and optimizations. We already collect plenty of observability data, but it’s waiting for the right person to design and build intuitive, delightful interfaces for it.
   

  

 What We Offer
   

  

* Highly competitive compensation (salary, equity, and benefits)
* The chance for your work to be open\-source and highly visible
* Freedom to expand your skills into new areas — whether infrastructure, machine learning, or beyond
* A small, focused, in\-person environment where technical quality and craftsmanship matter
* Backing from world\-class investors with a track record in AI, infrastructure, and developer tools


 What We're Looking For
   

  

* A strong technical foundation with the ability to lead and ship large projects (starting with the observability dashboard)
* Passion for building interfaces that not only work but truly delight developers
* Front\-end engineering experience — we're currently experimenting with Remix and Tailwind but need dedicated expertise (especially in React)
* Eagerness to learn and contribute across domains

 We're looking for an experienced frontend engineer. We want someone with programming (and ideally also design) chops who can own the frontend and take our product to the next level as we scale.
   

  

 We're building a PaaS that runs in a user's own cloud (basically Heroku on k8s) and we've converted some of Heroku's largest enterprise users as well as a large base of high\-growth startups despite starting just a little over a year ago.
   

  

 Now that we're hitting our stride, we're focused on capturing as much mindshare as possible, so we need someone who can take the polish and devX of our PaaS to the next level.
   

  

 This role would involve maximum ownership. Our entire engineering team is currently full\-stack (leaning backend) or on infra side. I (Justin) do most of the day\-to\-day FE/UX work as a founder, so we want someone with more experience who can do it worlds better.
   

  

**You Will**
* Obsess over delivering the best possible user flow for teams on Porter
* Elevate the design language of our platform
* Incrementally refactor the frontend without hampering the team's velocity
* Raise the standard for code quality and our engineering culture


**Some Of The Technical Challenges We Face**
* Rock solid UI/UX for onboarding \- our platform automatically provisions resources to the user's cloud account and needs to robustly handle a variety of permissions and infra\-related errors.
* Abstracting CI and Kubernetes \- any PaaS spans a variety of use cases, so building a consistent and useful layer of abstraction requires constant awareness of the needs of many user profiles.
* Auto\-Generated Frontend \- each of our app/add\-on templates uses a form.yaml file that programmatically generates a settings UI on the dashboard using a library of our own input primitives. Expanding and testing the functionality of these templates is non\-trivial.


**Tech Stack**
* Web: React (styled\-components), TypeScript
* Backend: Go, Kubernetes \+ Helm APIs, Postgres, Redis
* Infrastructure: AWS, GCP
