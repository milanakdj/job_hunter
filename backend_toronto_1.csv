Marvell’s semiconductor solutions are the essential building blocks of the data infrastructure that connects our world. Across enterprise, cloud and AI, automotive, and carrier architectures, our innovative technology is enabling new possibilities.
At Marvell, you can affect the arc of individual lives, lift the trajectory of entire industries, and fuel the transformative potential of tomorrow. For those looking to make their mark on purposeful and enduring innovation, above and beyond fleeting trends, Marvell is a place to thrive, learn, and lead.
Your Team, Your Impact
As an Analog Layout Engineer with Marvell, you’ll be a member of the Central Engineering business group. If you picture Marvell as a wheel, Central Engineering is the center hub providing IP to be used by all the other spokes on that wheel, including Automotive, Storage, Security, and Networking. You’ll be part of a small analog team making a big impact on this organization. Additionally, Marvell has the perfect size and scale for you to learn several aspects of engineering that will be new to you, but also have the time and freedom to dive deep into the details of your specialization on most projects.
What You Can Expect
You will be working with global teams in Argentina, Singapore, the U.S., and throughout Europe. You’ll receive a schematic from an Analog IC Designer. You will then take that schematic and use a CAD tool to graphically design the layers of that schematic. Then, you run simulations and verifications on the design using Cadence Virtuoso, refine and debug as needed in concert with the designer, and both of you keep iterating the design until it meets the desired specifications.  

  

Each project can last from a couple months to a year and a half. You will likely work on just one project in that time, but may be asked to switch to something else if priorities change. Your flexibility is appreciated.  

  

You’ll meet every few days with the designer you’re paired with to share information and work together. No circuits get built or tested here without you both, so your partnership and teamwork is extremely valuable to Marvell. You’ll also have routine meetings with your technical mentor when you have questions, as well as the layout team and the project team where you may have to speak to the entire group and update them about your progress. You may have to present a particular issue or solution you’ve encountered. We are developing brand new cutting\\-edge technologies here, so we learn new things frequently and share with our colleagues.
What We're Looking For
To be successful in this role, you must:  

* Have fundamental understanding of electrical concepts, likely acquired through a degree in Electrical Engineering (graduate or undergraduate).
* Have some specialized course work in analog design or layout, either as part of your Electrical Engineering degree, summer courses, or conference courses.
* Know how to use CAD tools to do the implementation layers, microelectronic layers in design that go beyond the schematics.
* Have excellent communication skills to give status updates to your team, present to global teams in different time zones, and to share information with many different levels of personnel at Marvell. Fluency in English is required.

Additional Compensation and Benefit Elements
With competitive compensation and great benefits, you will enjoy our workstyle within an environment of shared collaboration, transparency, and inclusivity. We’re dedicated to giving our people the tools and resources they need to succeed in doing work that matters, and to grow and develop with us. For additional information on what it’s like to work at Marvell, visit our Careers page.
All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.

*Ontario's playground awaits: a region where pristine lakes, island\\-dotted Georgian Bay, and endless forests create the backdrop for your daily practice. We represent clinics throughout Muskoka Kawartha Lakes and Georgian Bay where you can build a meaningful career without sacrificing the lifestyle that draws millions of visitors every year.*

*""I spent years treating pets whose owners would tell me about their amazing cottage weekends. Now I live and practice where they vacation, and my 'weekend getaway' is my everyday life."" \\- DVM who traded GTA burnout for Cottage Country fulfillment*

***Our Cottage Country Portfolio Features:***

* *Practices ranging from Barrie to Parry Sound to Bancroft, and the communities in between*
* *Clinics that understand seasonal fluctuations and staff accordingly (summer busy season won't break your spirit)*
* *Teams where experience is valued and mentorship is genuine*

***Cottage Country Lifestyle Benefits:***

* *Housing that's more affordable than the GTA (with waterfront possibilities actually within reach)*
* *Four\\-season recreation literally at your doorstep: boating, swimming, hiking, skiing, snowmobiling*
* *Small\\-town community with surprising cultural richness and Toronto just a couple hours away when needed*

***Who We're Looking For:***

* *You're adaptable to the seasonal rhythm of cottage country practice, comfortable building relationships with both year\\-round residents and seasonal visitors, and genuinely enjoy the pace of smaller community medicine.*

***A Year in Cottage Country Practice***

***Summer Season (Peak):*** *The practice hums with activity as seasonal residents and tourists flood the region. You'll treat everything from boat accident injuries to wildlife encounters, all while knowing that after your shift, you can be on your own dock or hiking trail within minutes. The pace is brisk but manageable because our practices plan for the summer surge.*

***Fall Season (Shoulder):*** *As the leaves turn spectacular colors, the pace eases slightly. You'll enjoy a mix of year\\-round residents and weekenders, with more time to build client relationships. The region's beauty takes on a new dimension, and you'll have time to actually enjoy those fall hikes and harvest festivals.*

***Winter Season (Off\\-Peak):*** *Practice shifts to primarily serving year\\-round residents, with a focus on wellness care and scheduled procedures. The community feels more intimate, and you become part of the fabric of winter life—whether that means snowshoeing, skating on frozen lakes, or enjoying the quiet beauty that tourists rarely see.*

***Spring Season (Renewal):*** *As the region awakens, you'll experience the unique joy of watching cottage country come back to life. The practice begins to pick up again, but there's still time to enjoy spring fishing, early season boating, and trail exploration before the summer crowds return.*

***The Real Scoop on Cottage Country Practice***

***The Undeniable Advantages:***

* *Living in one of Ontario's most beautiful regions all year round*
* *Building wealth through more affordable real estate and lower cost of living*
* *Developing genuine long\\-term relationships with year\\-round clients*
* *Practicing true community medicine where your role is valued and visible*
* *The mental health benefits of daily access to nature and water*

***The Honest Realities:***

* *Seasonal fluctuations require adaptability (busy summers, quieter winters)*
* *Some specialty services require referral to larger centers*
* *Fewer big\\-city amenities (though more than you might expect)*
* *Winter driving skills are non\\-negotiable*
* *A smaller pool of professional peers compared to urban centers*

***The Unexpected Delights:***

* *Treating the pet of someone who later serves you at the local restaurant or helps you at the hardware store*
* *The genuine gratitude from a community that values having quality veterinary care nearby*
* *Combining work and pleasure (like taking the boat to work in summer)*
* *The deep sense of belonging that comes from being part of a tight\\-knit community*
* *The daily reminder that you're living where others save all year to visit*

*At Goodvet, we understand that Ontario’s Cottage Country offers unique veterinary opportunities. The practices we represent provide competitive compensation (often with production bonuses), genuine work\\-life balance, and connection to communities that truly value veterinary care. If trading urban stress for lake\\-view sunsets sounds appealing, email your CV to hello@goodvet.ca and let's start the conversation.*

Marvell’s semiconductor solutions are the essential building blocks of the data infrastructure that connects our world. Across enterprise, cloud and AI, automotive, and carrier architectures, our innovative technology is enabling new possibilities.
At Marvell, you can affect the arc of individual lives, lift the trajectory of entire industries, and fuel the transformative potential of tomorrow. For those looking to make their mark on purposeful and enduring innovation, above and beyond fleeting trends, Marvell is a place to thrive, learn, and lead.
Your Team, Your Impact
As an Analog Layout Engineer with Marvell, you’ll be a member of the Central Engineering business group. If you picture Marvell as a wheel, Central Engineering is the center hub providing IP to be used by all the other spokes on that wheel, including Automotive, Storage, Security, and Networking. You’ll be part of a small analog team making a big impact on this organization. Additionally, Marvell has the perfect size and scale for you to learn several aspects of engineering that will be new to you, but also have the time and freedom to dive deep into the details of your specialization on most projects.
What You Can Expect
You will be working with global teams in Argentina, Singapore, the U.S., and throughout Europe. You’ll receive a schematic from an Analog IC Designer. You will then take that schematic and use a CAD tool to graphically design the layers of that schematic. Then, you run simulations and verifications on the design using Cadence Virtuoso, refine and debug as needed in concert with the designer, and both of you keep iterating the design until it meets the desired specifications.  

  

Each project can last from a couple months to a year and a half. You will likely work on just one project in that time, but may be asked to switch to something else if priorities change. Your flexibility is appreciated.  

  

You’ll meet every few days with the designer you’re paired with to share information and work together. No circuits get built or tested here without you both, so your partnership and teamwork is extremely valuable to Marvell. You’ll also have routine meetings with your technical mentor when you have questions, as well as the layout team and the project team where you may have to speak to the entire group and update them about your progress. You may have to present a particular issue or solution you’ve encountered. We are developing brand new cutting\\-edge technologies here, so we learn new things frequently and share with our colleagues.
What We're Looking For
To be successful in this role, you must:  

* Have fundamental understanding of electrical concepts, likely acquired through a degree in Electrical Engineering (graduate or undergraduate).
* Have some specialized course work in analog design or layout, either as part of your Electrical Engineering degree, summer courses, or conference courses.
* Know how to use CAD tools to do the implementation layers, microelectronic layers in design that go beyond the schematics.
* Have excellent communication skills to give status updates to your team, present to global teams in different time zones, and to share information with many different levels of personnel at Marvell. Fluency in English is required.

Additional Compensation and Benefit Elements
With competitive compensation and great benefits, you will enjoy our workstyle within an environment of shared collaboration, transparency, and inclusivity. We’re dedicated to giving our people the tools and resources they need to succeed in doing work that matters, and to grow and develop with us. For additional information on what it’s like to work at Marvell, visit our Careers page.
