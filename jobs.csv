U.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long\\-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings.



Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday (for non\\-exempt employees), plus a day off for their birthday. Non\\-Exempt new hires accrue up to 16 days of vacation time off each year, at a rate of 4\\.92 hours per pay period. Exempt new hires participate in Cisco's flexible Vacation Time Off policy, which does not place a defined limit on how much vacation time eligible employees may use, but is subject to availability and some business limitations. All new hires are eligible for Sick Time Off subject to Cisco's Sick Time Off Policy and will have eighty (80\\) hours of sick time off provided on their hire date and on January 1st of each year thereafter. Up to 80 hours of unused sick time will be carried forward from one calendar year to the next such that the maximum number of sick time hours an employee may have available is 160 hours. Employees in Illinois have a unique time off program designed specifically with local requirements in mind. All employees also have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.



Employees on sales plans earn performance\\-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non\\-quota components. For quota\\-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows:



.75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;



1\\.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;



1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.



For non\\-quota\\-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.","","https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/W-EI_IE391788.htm","https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/391788/meraki-squareLogo-1677739666599.png","","","","","","","","","","",""

	+ Iterate and improve our existing architecture to support the business at a 10x → 100x scale, while maintaining and reducing overheads.
* Leverage LLMs to revolutionize our approach to problem\\-solving, enabling us to tackle complex challenges with unprecedented efficiency and creativity, while continuously pushing the boundaries of what's possible in software development and user experience design. Eg.
   

	+ build a document processing engine that is able to ingest unstructured or heterogenous data (e.g. PDFs, scanned images, etc) and extract structured data and insights. Leverage this capability to automate business critical workflows.
	+ build AI bots / RPAs to automate end to end lifecycle of user centric features that add value to the users' overall experience with the CloudTrucks platform. Eg. chatbots, task automatons, etc.

 We're building the AI\\-powered operating system for the next generation of software creation—where traditional engineers and non\\-technical builders (think lawyers, designers, and founders) can collaborate, create, and deploy AI\\-driven applications using plain English.
 



 This isn’t just another IDE or low\\-code tool. We’re threading an impossible needle:
 


* **Deep enough** 
 for engineers who demand power and flexibility.
* **Accessible enough** 
 for domain experts who’ve never written a line of code.
* **Compelling enough** 
 to make both groups wonder how they ever worked without it.



 If you’ve ever wanted to architect systems that redefine how software is built—and see your work used by hundreds of thousands of builders—this is your shot.
 


**What You’ll Do** 
* **Architect foundational systems** 
 for collaborative AI development (think Google Docs meets VSCode, with real\\-time multi\\-user editing via Y.js).
* **Build and scale LLM orchestration** 
 that actually works—low latency, debuggable, and reliable for both real\\-time and long\\-running AI agents.
* **Solve hard problems** 
 , like designing an executor that handles arbitrarily long\\-running agents, scales from zero to thousands in seconds, and remains traceable for end users.
* **Write a ton of code** 
 (mostly TypeScript/Next.js) while keeping our AWS/Cloudflare stack humming.
* **Wear multiple hats** 
 : debug user issues, make product calls on the fly, and help shape the future of AI development.


**Who You Are** 
* **4\\+ years** 
 of experience building real products used by real people.
* **An AI\\-curious engineer** 
 with hands\\-on experience building with LLMs (bonus if you’ve worked on agents or orchestration).
* **Technical chops** 
 : Strong TypeScript skills (our whole stack is TS), front\\-end fluency (React/Next.js), and solid system design intuition.
* **A builder at heart** 
 : You’ve shipped side projects, contributed to OSS, or have a presence that shows you love creating things.
* **Low ego, high output** 
 : You fix problems before being asked, care more about users than your code, and thrive in fast\\-moving environments.
* **Ex\\-founder/CTO?** 
 Even better—our team is stacked with former startup leaders who’ve raised VC, but we’re open to exceptional engineers who just love to build.


**Nice\\-to\\-Haves** 
* STEM degree from a top\\-tier school.
* Experience with real\\-time collaboration tools (CRDTs, WebSockets, etc.).
* A knack for making complex systems feel simple.


**Traits We Avoid** 
* Unfounded arrogance (we’re a low\\-ego team).
* Poor communicators (we move fast—clear, concise wins).


**Why Join?** 
* Work with
 **ex\\-CTOs and founders** 
 who’ve built and scaled before.
* Shape the
 **AI operating system** 
 that will define the next era of software.
* Backed by
 **$30M in seed funding** 
 (largest in YC history).
* **300K\\+ signups** 
 and growing fast.","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
