* Ensure compliance with each retailer’s vendor guidelines and shipping protocols.
* Liaise with internal IT and external service providers to maintain EDI infrastructure.
* Develop and maintain documentation for EDI/ASN procedures and retailer\\-specific requirements.
* Generate performance reports and KPIs related to ASN timeliness and compliance; suggest improvements where necessary.
* Act as a key point of contact for our retail partners' logistics and IT compliance teams.

**Required Qualifications:**

* 3\\+ years of hands\\-on experience with **EDI and ASN processing**, specifically with **Canadian Tire and Walmart Canada**.
* Proven experience shipping to both DCs and stores for these retailers.
* Deep understanding of **retail compliance**, including routing guides, labeling, and document requirements.

* Experience generating and interpreting compliance or ASN performance reports.

**Preferred Skills:**

* Familiarity with EDI translators and mapping tools (e.g., SPS Commerce, TrueCommerce, OpenText, etc.).
* Experience working in a **3PL environment**.
* Basic scripting or technical skills (FTP, XML/EDI file structures, etc.) are a plus.

**Why Join Blue Dog 3PL?**

* Be part of a growing, agile logistics company where your contributions make a visible impact.
* Work alongside a team that values precision, ownership, and continuous improvement.
* Competitive compensation with room for growth.

 **Who We Are**  

We are an award\\-winning and rapidly growing company that builds clients’ brands through innovative branded merchandise programs. Founded in 1980 and headquartered in Toronto, we now operate seamlessly across North America.


Large enough to work with some of North America's most high\\-profile brands, we're also small enough to appreciate the individual contributions that make our success possible. Our team is enthusiastic and creative, and together we’re a dynamic, growing company focused on culture and success.


We have been named a top 40 distributor by both ASI and PPAI, recognized as one of Canada’s Best Managed Companies for the past seven years, and awarded National Distributor of the Year by PPPC more times than we can count. Ok. We counted. 16 times.

  

In 2023 we achieved B\\-Corp Certification and became proud members of the B\\-Corp community, doing our part to create a positive impact for society and the environment. Caring about the communities we live in *and* the ones we don’t are at the core of who we are.

 **About The Role**


Our teams manage major accounts whose brands are part of our everyday lives and shape our culture. We have a ton of merch that come in and out of our warehouse every day. How this role fits in the grand scheme of Genumark is that as a Warehouse Associate, you play a key role in ensuring accurate receiving, storage, and order fulfilment to keep products moving from suppliers to clients efficiently.


Accuracy, attention to detail, and organization is the name of the game – you will support fast\\-paced operations, maintain inventory accuracy, and help drive customer satisfaction through timely and precise order handling. Your attention to detail and commitment to safety will directly impact the success of our operations.


Additionally, this role involves a high degree of physical activity each day – lifting up to forty pounds unaided, as well as standing for long periods of time, working in awkward positions (twisting, bending, crouching), repetitive manual operations (such as packing small parts quickly, etc.), pushing and pulling objects in general, pushing and pulling hand carts.


Key responsibilities include, but not be limited to:

* Receive and inspect incoming shipments for accuracy and damage
* Pick, pack, and prepare orders for shipment
* Manage various shipping methods, with the most cost\\-effective method carefully selected
* Load and unload trucks using pallet jacks or forklifts (if certified)
* Ability to lift up to 40 lbs and stand/walk for extended periods
* Ability to use an RF scanner
* Maintain accurate inventory records and assist with inventory counts
* Keep warehouse clean, organized, and in compliance with safety standards
* Operate basic warehouse equipment and tools safely and efficiently
* Follow company procedures and safety protocols at all times
* Strong attention to detail and organizational skills
* Ability to work independently and as part of a team
* Assist in other duties as assigned by the warehouse supervisor or manager


This role is based at our Head office (Gordon Baker Road) and requires working on\\-site daily.

 **Who You Are**


Your professional toolbox contains customer\\-first mindset, collaboration, commitment, and compassion. You love to make a difference in customer experience and are intentional in delivering a personalized service. You value quality and take pride in your work because you know it directly affects our clients and wowing them is a huge deal to you.

  

You commit. You do what you say you’ll do and you are focused on meeting deadlines. Presented with a challenge, you’ve got a “Yes!” attitude and are focused on finding a solution. You are meticulous, organised, resourceful, and excel under pressure. Personable and open minded, you are comfortable collaborating and communicate well with all peers.

 **What we Offer**


We're not just offering a job, we're offering a platform for your success. Our team is amazing (at least we think so!) and our operational support is top\\-notch. You have the opportunity to work with some great folks, learn about some pretty cool merch, and sometimes, own a few of them too!


We offer a great benefit package, we have fun office events, and we care about your sense of well\\-being and belonging.


As for compensation, the range is between $43,000 \\- $48,000 annually.
